    <h1>My Cat Marvel</h1>
    <p>The <em>Marvel</em> is <em>awesome</em> because <strong>she is the defender of everything 
      good and also she follows me around the house because she is the most perfect being to ever exist. </strong> 
      She is incredibly sweet, and loves trying to sit on my laptop case and my books (while I'm reading).</p>
